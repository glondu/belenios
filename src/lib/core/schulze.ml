   The strength of a direct beat by choice A over choice B is a pair
   (W,L) where W>L and W is the number of ballots that rank A over B,
   and L is the number of ballots that rank B over A.

   Direct beats are totally ordered, with losing votes mattering
   only if winning votes are tied:
   (W1,L1) > (W2,L2) iff (W1 > W2) or (W1 = W2 and L1 < L2)

(* The strength of a path (beatpath) is the min of the strengths of
   all the links along the path. To compare two choices, we look at
   the max of all the beatpaths between them.  If the max of the
   beatpaths from A to B is stronger than the max of all the beatpaths
   from B to A, then A is ranked above B.  *)

(** [compute_initial_matrix m] returns a matrix which is the initial

   (0,0): the one that contains a larger value in [m]. That element is
   initialized to a pair containing the larger and the smaller of the
   two values.  Thus, diagonal elements are initialized to (0,0); if
   m_ij=m_ji, both are initialized to (0,0).  *)

 Implementation: Computes the transitive closure with ratings, using
   the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, but with min = max, + = min.  This
   gives the necessary commutative semiring. Run time is O(n^3).  A
   classic of dynamic programming.  *)
