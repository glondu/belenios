# Documentation related to automated tests of Belenios

Automated tests are stored in the `tests` directory.

Technologies used to run these tests are:

- `python3`: Python 3 (version >= 3.6). We use it in a virtual environment (using Python's `venv` module)
- `pip`: Python's package manager. We use it to install Python packages such as `selenium` (`pip` installs packages mentioned in `requirements.txt`)
- `selenium`: Selenium's Python API ([documentation](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/))
- `firefox`: The browser we use to run tests with Selenium. We can use standard Firefox, or `firefox-esr`, depending what is available on the system and which Firefox version is compatible with Selenium at the moment
- `geckodriver`: A Firefox driver for Selenium. Its role is to translate commands received from Selenium using a specific protocol into concrete actions to trigger in the Firefox browser, and to trigger these actions.
- `unittest`: Python's standard test framework

These automated tests start the Belenios demo server (`demo/run-server.sh`), with the `BELENIOS_SENDMAIL` environment variable defined as the path to a fake `sendmail` executable (similar to a mock, provided in `tests/sendmail_fake.sh`). This way, Belenios server does not return an error when trying to send emails in the test environment (that has no `sendmail` installed nor configured), and the fake `sendmail` executable makes it possible to verify what emails have been sent and read their content, simply by reading the log file where it redirects all its input (we use `/tmp/sendmail_fake` as location for this log file).

Note: For example, during election creation procedure, a step sends emails to voters. If at this moment, a `sendmail` binary is not properly installed and configured (or replaced by a mock), the web page displays the following error message: `Netchannels.Command_failure(WEXITED 126)`

When these automated tests start running, and when they end, they clean up Belenios database: Belenios database consists in directories and files under the `_run/spool` directory, for each election. So these are deleted during test setup. Belenios demo server stores initial admin users logins and passwords in `demo/password_db.csv`. This file is not deleted during test setup, and its contents are used to log in the adminstrator during the test and have this administrator create an election.

Automated tests can be executed manually, or via Continuous Integration. Next sub-sections explain how to execute them in each of these 2 contexts.


## Executing automated test suites manually on your local machine

You can execute a test suite by running its python script from your Python virtual environment, given you have already installed its `pip` requirements, `firefox` and `geckodriver`. Automated tests need that Belenios server has already been compiled. So if you have not done any of these, this is the sequence of commands that you can execute:

```
export GECKODRIVER_VERSION=0.18.0
wget --no-verbose -O /tmp/geckodriver.tar.gz https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v$GECKODRIVER_VERSION/geckodriver-v$GECKODRIVER_VERSION-linux64.tar.gz && rm -rf /opt/geckodriver && sudo tar -C /opt -zxf /tmp/geckodriver.tar.gz && rm /tmp/geckodriver.tar.gz && sudo mv /opt/geckodriver /opt/geckodriver-$GECKODRIVER_VERSION && sudo chmod 755 /opt/geckodriver-$GECKODRIVER_VERSION && sudo ln -fs /opt/geckodriver-$GECKODRIVER_VERSION /usr/bin/geckodriver

sudo apt-get install -y -qq python3 python3-venv firefox

source ./env.sh
make build-debug-server
make build-debug-tool

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./tests/selenium/test_scenario_1.py
```

Note: Depending on the version of `firefox` that you use, you may need to adjust the version of `geckodriver` to download and install. Please refer to this compatibility table: https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/geckodriver/Support.html

Note: The `make all` command exits in error if `ocamlbuild` finds compiled files (including `.so` shared libraries) other than the ones it expects. So, make sure that you run this command before creation of the Python virtual environment and installation of `pip` requirements. If you want to re-compile Belenios after this, you can simply delete the `venv` folder.

Note: We cannot run the Belenios server from a folder that is not the git repository root, otherwise it exits immediately in an error: `This script should be run from the root of the (built) source tree!`.


## Executing automated tests using Continuous Integration

For this, we run a Docker image (built from `contrib/docker/gitlab-ci.Dockerfile`) that preinstalls compatible versions of `firefox-esr`, `geckodriver`, `python`, and python virtual environment.

File `.gitlab-ci.yml` defines a task `build_and_run_automated_test_scenario_1_with_preinstalled_image` that uses this docker image, compiles belenios, creates a python virtual environment, steps into it, installs pip required packages, and then executes the automated test suite.

Note: You can execute this Continuous Integration task as if you were running GitlabCI, by executing the following command:

```
gitlab-runner exec docker build_and_run_automated_test_scenario_1_with_preinstalled_image
```

Note: The Docker image has been built and pushed to Docker Hub using the following commands:

```
docker-compose -f contrib/docker/gitlab-ci.docker-compose.yml build
docker tag beleniosbase glondu/beleniosbase:YYYYMMDD-N
docker tag beleniosbase-tests glondu/beleniosbase-tests:YYYYMMDD-N
docker push glondu/beleniosbase-tests:YYYYMMDD-N
docker push glondu/beleniosbase:YYYYMMDD-N
```

We use `YYYYMMDD-N` for docker-tagging, where `YYYYMMDD` is the build date, and `N` is a sequence number.


## Customizing configuration variables of Test Scenario 1

Test `test_scenario_1.py` executes using some default configuration that can be customized, by setting some environment variables when executing the script.

The list of configuration variables is:

- `RANDOM_SEED`: An integer used as seed for the random number generator of Python. By default, a random seed is used. Seed used is displayed at every run of the test, so you can re-run the test using the same random seed by setting this configuration variable to the value displayed.
- `USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER`: Set this to non-zero (True) if you run this test in Continuous Integration (it has no graphical display). Set this to 0 (False) if you want to see the browser open its graphical user interface and visually track progress ot the test. By default, the falue is True.
- `WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP`: In seconds (float). Time we wait between each action that we tell Selenium driver to do in the browser. Set to 0 if you don't need to have the time to visually follow progress of actions in the browser
- `EXPLICIT_WAIT_TIMEOUT`: In seconds. Maximum duration Selenium driver will wait for appearance of a specific DOM element expected in the page (for example when transitioning from a page to another). This referes to Selenium's "Explicit Wait" concept
- `SENT_EMAILS_TEXT_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH`
- `NUMBER_OF_INVITED_VOTERS`: This is N in description of Scenario 1. N is between 6 (quick test) and 1000 (load testing)
- `NUMBER_OF_VOTING_VOTERS`: This is K in description of Scenario 1. K is between 6 (quick test) and 1000 (load testing). K <= N. (Some invited voters don't vote, this is abstention, and its value is N - K)
- `NUMBER_OF_REVOTING_VOTERS`: This is L in description of Scenario 1. L <= K
- `NUMBER_OF_REGENERATED_PASSWORD_VOTERS`: This is M in description of Scenario 1. M <= K
- `SENT_EMAILS_TEXT_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH`: By default, this is "/tmp/sendmail_fake"
- `ADMINISTRATOR_USERNAME`: By default, this value comes from file `demo/password_db.csv`, first row, first column
- `ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD`: By default, this value comes from file `demo/password_db.csv`, first row, 4th column
- `BOOTH_VERSION`: The version of the web booth to be used by automatic voters. Default is `CLASSIC_BOOTH`, which is the original booth and is the most widely translated, but handles only the classic type of questions, which is checkboxes or radio buttons. Another accepted value is `RESPONSIVE_BOOTH`, which is translated in fewer languages but handles questions of type classic and alternative (more precisely Majority Judgement and Preference Voting)

Other automated tests (files `test_scenario_2.py`, `test_scenario_3.py`, etc) also have configuration variables, and some of them are in common. Here is an example of how you can set configuration variables and execute the test in your terminal:

```
RANDOM_SEED=222 WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP=1.2 USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 NUMBER_OF_INVITED_VOTERS=4 python3 ./tests/selenium/test_scenario_1.py
```

## Prepared database

You can construct a prepared database (contents of folder `_run/spool`) with several elections and invited voters, and optionnaly with some voters who have already submitted their ballot. Building such a database, loading it into Belenios and executing automated tests on it make it possible to evaluate any difference in behaviour or in duration between an "empty" Belenios server and a "crowded" one.

File `.gitlab-ci.yml` defines a task `build_and_run_automated_test_scenarios_with_preinstalled_image_and_prepared_database` that downloads a prepared database and places it into `_run/spool` before executing tests. This task is only executed once in a while (at every new release of Belenios), not at every commit.

Here is how you can build your own prepared database (for example if you want to add new elections to the prepared database used in this task):

- Execute the Python/Selenium script which creates an election, invites some voters, generates their ballots, and stores them into a CSV file: See section `Execute the script that creates the election and generates ballot files and the aggregated votes CSV file`
- Execute the JMeter script which, for each row of the previously generated CSV file, submits a voter's ballot to the election: See section `Load testing: Executing scenario of vote with already prepared ballots, using JMeter`

You can now execute automated tests locally and analyse their results. If you want to update or replace the prepared database used in the Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery pipeline, download its compressed file, unzip its contents and merge them into your local `_run/spool` folder. Then compress the whole folder and upload its compressed version to a public URL and replace the URL in `.gitlab-ci.yml` by your own.

Good to know: If you version the prepared database using a git repository like gitlab or github, the VCS platform automatically generates a compressed file associated to latest commit on master branch and to commits which have tags. So you don't need to compress and upload the file yourself, just copy its URL and paste it into `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Monkey testing and fuzz testing

### Notes related to monkey testing and fuzz testing

Several tests have a same general behaviour in common, which depends on the value you set in some environment variables when you execute the test. Here are notes about some of them:

- `WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP`: Do not set a value below 0.02 seconds, otherwise hypothesis test becomes flaky.
- `START_SERVER`: Can be set to `0` or `1` to respectively use an already running Belenios server or let the script start its own Belenios server.
- `ELECTION_ID`: If you do not provide a value to this variable, the test will try to create an election, invite voters, and fill other variables from it with correct values extracted from data obtained during the creation of the election (`VOTER_USERNAME`, `VOTER_PASSWORD`, `VOTER_CREDENTIAL`). If you do provide a value to `ELECTION_ID`, you should also provide a value to these other variables.
- `USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER`: Can be set to `0` or `1` to respectively display the Graphical User Interface of the browser while executing the test (this is a useful visual feedback for debugging), or to execute its headless mode which opens no window. If you set it to `0`, make sure that you don't change focus during execution (with your mouse or while switching windows on your computer), as it interferes with the automatic instructions that the browser receives from Selenium (for example, detection of Alerts becomes flaky).

### Fuzz testing of the main login form

You can execute test `test_fuzz_login.py` the following way:

```
START_SERVER=1 LOGIN_MODE="local" USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP=0.02 python ./tests/selenium/test_fuzz_login.py
```

### Fuzz testing of the "Advanced mode" voting process

Fuzz testing of the "Advanced mode" voting process consists in:

- opening the URL of an election
- clicking on the "Advanced mode" link
- trying to vote with a dumb monkey who fuzz tests with random input as ballot, submits it and verifies that he receives a failure message saying that ballot content is invalid
- and then trying to vote with a smart monkey who fuzz tests with a properly structured but still incorrect ballot (this enables him to move to the login step)
- logging in using a correct combination of username and password
- verifying that user arrives on Step 5
- clicking on confirm ballot subscription button
- verifying that user arrives on Step 6, and that it displays a failure message (because ballot content is invalid)

This test is implemented in file `test_fuzz_vote.py`. It can be executed either on an already existing election, or it can create a new election itself and then execute the test. Here are examples of both ways of using it:

- Let the script create its own election

```
SENT_EMAILS_TEXT_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH=/path/to/your/repository/_build/src/static/mail.txt FAKE_SENT_EMAILS_FILE_RELATIVE_URL=static/mail.txt WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP=0.02 USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 START_SERVER=0 python ./tests/selenium/test_fuzz_vote.py
```

- Use an already existing election. For this, you provide the election ID as well as a username and password for a voter who has been already invited.

```
WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP=0.02 USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 START_SERVER=0 ELECTION_ID=4qjJRMg4b26ax5 VOTER_USERNAME=nrmt1fl7z05zaqnn0luo@example.org VOTER_PASSWORD=LLP3269TVNDMF6 python ./tests/selenium/test_fuzz_vote.py
```

### Clicker Monkey testing

There are 2 tests in `test_clicker_monkey.py`:

- `test_clicker_monkey_on_election_home()`: Clicker Monkey goes to the home page of the election, and clicks randomly on links and buttons, up to 200 times. It uses a fence function to ignore pages which match certain criteria: these are pages which are out of the scope of analysis (pages outside of the Belenios server domain or sub-domain). On every other page, it verifies that the page is not an unexpected error page. It randomly clicks on the "Previous" button of the browser (which goes back on the previous page).
- `test_sometimes_smart_monkey_votes()`: It starts like previous test, but for only up to 50 clicks. Then, the visitor does a normal vote and verifies everything went correctly. This test verifies that a single visitor who does random actions at the beginning of his visit can still complete a vote without problem.

Here is an example of how to execute these tests:

```
START_SERVER=0 CLEAN_UP_POLICY=DO_NOTHING SENT_EMAILS_TEXT_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH=/path/to/_build/src/static/mail.txt WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP=0.02 USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 python ./tests/selenium/test_clicker_monkey.py
```

### Smart Monkey testing

File `test_smart_monkey.py` executes a very smart monkey, who has memory and who knows perfectly the state machine of the voting process. Smart monkey receives at initialization some data to store in its memory (username, password, credential) and during the vote process, it will also store the smart ballot tracker which gets displayed and then check on the following pages that it does still appear and that its value is the same as the initial one. The smart monkey constantly knows which state of the state machine corresponds to the current page he is seeing, and what is the list of possible actions to do on this page. It decides randomly which action to do. Among these actions are clicking on a link or a button, as well as filling a form (or modal) with wrong data or with correct data. It can also decide to click on the "Previous" button of the browser, especially when it arrives on a dead end (a page with no available action from it, for example an "Unauthorized" page). After each action that the smart monkey does, it then verifies that the page he arrives on corresponds to the expected destination state of this transition in the state machine (and not to another page or to an error page). It stops running only once he has completed a vote. Then, the test verifies that the smart monkey's smart ballot tracker is displayed on the ballot box page.

This whole test verifies that a user who has a very random behaviour, but who really wants to vote correctly, can correctly vote.

You can execute it the following way:

```
ELECTION_ID=Vq7erXgTVs983H VOTER_USERNAME=3gzyo249nqgpjhx1puae@example.org VOTER_PASSWORD=dtx96KfMEuHqxd VOTER_CREDENTIAL=cbsopJ6QxpeLAyh START_SERVER=0 CLEAN_UP_POLICY=DO_NOTHING SENT_EMAILS_TEXT_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH=/home/quentin/prog/gitlab.inria.fr/belenios-forks/belenios-swergas/_build/src/static/mail.txt WAIT_TIME_BETWEEN_EACH_STEP=0.02 USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 python ./tests/selenium/test_smart_monkey.py
```

### Test Scenario 2 with a mix of normal voters and Smart Monkeys

File `test_scenario_2_with_monkeys.py` executes a variation on "Scenario 2: Vote with vote codes in manual mode and manual trustees" (which is implemented in `test_scenario_2.py`). This test creates an election with trustees, invites voters, and makes several voters vote. A first part of voters execute a normal vote. A second part of voters are Smart Monkeys, with a behaviour described in previous "Smart Monkey testing" section. A third part of voters execute also a normal vote. Some randomly selected voters revote. Then administrator starts tallying the election, trustees do the validation, and administrator completes the tallying of the election. Administrator verifies that global vote results corresponds to the expected ones. Several verifications of the consistency of the election occur during the whole process, exactly like in the initial Scenario 2 test.

This whole test verifies that despite having some smart monkey voters, other voters can vote correctly and the whole election continues to work as expected and to produce expected vote results.

You can execute it the following way:

```
USE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=0 NUMBER_OF_INVITED_VOTERS=30 NUMBER_OF_VOTING_VOTERS=15 NUMBER_OF_MONKEY_VOTING_VOTERS=7 NUMBER_OF_VOTING_VOTERS_IN_FIRST_PART=4 NUMBER_OF_REVOTING_VOTERS=1 python3 ./tests/selenium/test_scenario_2_with_monkeys.py
```
