Dear trustee,

You will find below the link to generate your private decryption key, used to tally the election.

{link_for_trustee}

Here's the instructions:
1. click on the link
2. click on "generate a new key pair"
3. your private key will appear in another window or tab. Make sure
you SAVE IT properly otherwise it will not possible to tally and the
election will be canceled.
4. in the first window, click on "submit" to send the public part of
your key, used encrypt the votes. For verification purposes, you
should save this part (that starts with "pok" "challenge"), for
example sending yourself an email.

Regarding your private key, it is crucial you save it (otherwise the
election will be canceled) and store it securely (if your private key
is known together with the private keys of the other trustees, then
vote privacy is no longer guaranteed). We suggest two options:
1. you may store the key on a USB stick and store it in a safe.
2. Or you may simply print it and store it in a safe.
Of course, more cryptographic solutions are welcome as well.

Thank you for your help,
